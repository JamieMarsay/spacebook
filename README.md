# Jamie's React Boilerplate

## Yet another React boilerplate! ðŸ™ƒ

The boilerplate makes no assumptions about what components, libraries or tools you may or may not require. Add what you need, when you need it.

There are two basic components and a handful of CSS classes included.

Quick setup for new projects, comes with:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Webpack Dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#using-webpack-dev-server)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [SASS loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader)
- [File loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/file-loader/)
- [CSS Nano](https://cssnano.co/)
- [HTML Webpack Plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin)

More will be added as the boilerplate grows...
